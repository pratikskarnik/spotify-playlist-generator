# Spotify Playlist Generator

This is a Python-based command-line tool that generates a playlist of songs based on a set of user-defined preferences. The playlist is generated using the Spotify API and can be saved to the user's Spotify account.

# Installation
To use this tool, you will need Python 3.6 or later installed on your machine. You will also need to obtain a Spotify API key and create a Spotify developer account.

Once you have your API key, clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pratikskarnik/spotify-playlist-generator.git
```
Then, navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies using pip:

```bash
cd spotify-playlist-generator
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
# Usage
To use the tool, run the playlist_generator.py script using the following command:

```bash
python app.py
```
This will prompt you to log in to your Spotify account and provide some preferences for your playlist, such as genre, tempo, and popularity. The tool will then use the Spotify API to generate a playlist of songs that match your preferences and add it to your Spotify account.
